3.2 The quality of the signal is not uniform throughout. We that the interpolation is better towards the middle region but is not 
    perfect towards the end as there arent enough right and left side samples for the right and left end of the signal for interpolation.
    
    Error obtained for:
    1) Linear: 2.994
    2) Zero Hold: 0.3827
    3) Sinc interpolation: 0.3313
 
 3.3 As the Ts increases it is noticed that there are more samples that form the reconstructed signal. This is seen when compared 
     to the original signal.
     
 3.4 Nyquist frequency is 5Hz or 10*Pi rad/sec
     For 0.1secs, It has a sampling frequency of 10Hz which is more than nyquist rate so it is full reconstructed
     For 0.2secs, It has a sampling frequency of 10Hz which is equal to the nyquist rate so it is not entirely reconstruced through the rough shape can be seen
     For 0.3secs It is belownyquist rate due to which we see a different figure
     For 0.4secons is it even more irregular as there is less samples to sample on within that range which affects the accuracy
