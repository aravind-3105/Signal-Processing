4.1
Sampling Freqency: 8000Hz
Bits: 16
Number of levels = 2^(16)

As sampling frequency decreases,we notice that in the timedomain the sample is stretched

As sampling frequency increases, there is a squeezing in the time-domain of the signal which seems like the sample is playing fast sounding making it sound like Talking Tom xD.

Fourier transform property of frequency scaling is used here which results in time dilation or stretching.


4.2
As b increases,the xq[n], the level increases due to which its resemblance to original signal increases.

Maximum Absolute Error will decreases in the graph as levels increase as expected as it is equal to 1/(2^b).

SQNR will increase for each bit increase as seen in the theoritical value which matches the practical value almost perfectly.

4.3
The sample becomes more clear as the number of bits increases as it replicates the sample better reducing an distortion/error in the signal.
Frequency content of quantised signals decreases as level L is changed.
