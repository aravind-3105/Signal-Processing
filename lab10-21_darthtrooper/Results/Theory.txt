b) None of the IIR filters exhibit linear phase as see in the graph.
c) Elliptical seems to be more preferable relatively due to its equiripple in both the passband and stopband
   and fast/sharp transition band.
f) We see that the low pass filtering happens properly for all filters. The amplitude reduction and clear output also 
   verifies this.
